## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed before running the script:

- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (usually pre-installed)  
- `smtplib` (Python standard library)  
- `plyer` (for desktop notifications)  

Install `plyer` using pip:

```bash
pip install plyer
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mass-email-sender.git
cd mass-email-sender
```

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

### 3. Add Recipient Emails

- Enter an email in the **"Enter recipient email"** field  
- Click **"Add!"** to save it to `recipients.txt`  
- Repeat for each recipient  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The file `recipients.txt` is **overwritten** each time the app starts (due to `"w"` mode). To preserve recipients, modify the code to use **append mode** (`"a"`) or pre-populate the file manually.

### 4. Compose and Send

- Fill in your **Subject** and **Message**  
- Provide your **Gmail Email** and **Password**  
- Click **"Send Email"** to send messages  

You'll receive a desktop notification for each successful email sent.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Gmail Security:** You may need to enable **"Allow less secure apps"** in your Google Account settings *(no longer supported for most accounts)*  
- üîê **Recommended:** Use a **Google App Password** instead of your main password. Learn more from [Google's App Password Help Page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)

### üîß Error Handling Limitations

This basic version does not handle:

- Invalid email addresses  
- Network or connection errors  
- Incorrect login credentials  

You can improve the script by adding try/except blocks and input validation.
